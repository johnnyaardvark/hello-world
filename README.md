# hello-world
The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming.... 
Well here I am again? Is this really coding.... ????
Done that before. I was a database programmer / analyst for 7 years. 
I am now a teacher of Physics
but my main hobbies are music production - composing and playing mostly
and astronomy. 

I am found here because I found some information on VCVRack but also because I am an owner of a BASTL KASTL. Somewhere on here there's alternative code to run on it. Maybe I'll find it somewhere?!
